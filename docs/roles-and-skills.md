- **Containerization:** Docker basics.
- **Problem Solving:** Debugging, reading logs.
- **Collaboration:** Code review, technical documentation.

## My chosen role

### Role

Cyber Security Specialist (Red Team Analyst)

### Skills I already have

- **Python** (scripting, automation, basic network libraries)
- **C++** (OOP concepts, pointers, memory management)
- **PowerShell** (basic system administration, task automation)
- **Git** (branching, merging, pull requests via GitHub)
- **SQLite** (basic SQL queries, CRUD operations)
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (arrays, lists, trees, sorting, Big O analysis)
- **OS: MacOS, Windows** (advanced usage, terminal/CLI navigation)

### Skills I clearly lack

- **Computer Networking** (OSI Model, TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, Subnetting)
- **Linux Administration** (Bash scripting, file permissions, system hardening)
- **Web Security** (OWASP Top 10, SQLi, XSS, Burp Suite basics)
- **Cloud Computing** (AWS/Azure basics, IAM, cloud security concepts)
- **Containerization** (Docker, Kubernetes basics, isolation principles)

## Job market snapshot

### Skills that appear in several postings

- **MITRE ATT&CK & Cyber Kill Chain** (mentioned in almost every analysis/expert role)
- **Operating Systems Security** (Deep understanding of Windows & Linux internals)
- **Networking Protocols** (TCP/IP, OSI model, DNS, VPN principles)
- **Scripting & Automation** (Python, PowerShell, Bash for task automation)
- **SIEM/EDR experience** (Knowledge of monitoring and incident response tools)

### Skills specific to a single posting

- **Industrial Security (ICS/SCADA)** (Specific to the critical infrastructure role)
- **Russian Regulatory Compliance** (FSTEK, 187-FZ, CII protection)
- **Malware Evasion Techniques** (Specific to the Threat Hunting role)
- **Technical Presales** (RFP/RFI preparation, PoC deployment)
- **CTF/HackTheBox experience** (Explicitly mentioned as a plus for the Red Team role)

## Personal reflection

I chose the Cyber Security Specialist role because I enjoy understanding how systems work internally and finding ways to secure them against vulnerabilities. Compared to the market demands, I have a strong foundation in programming (C++, Python) and basic OS knowledge, but I lack specific security tools experience (SIEM, Burp Suite) and deep networking knowledge. This semester, I plan to focus on Computer Networking (TCP/IP, OSI) and Linux Administration, as these are the most critical "missing links" in my skillset required by almost every job posting I analyzed. Mastering these will allow me to start practicing on platforms like TryHackMe more effectively.
